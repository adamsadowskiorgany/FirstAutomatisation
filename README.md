# FirstAutomatisation

Welcome to my first steps in Selenium WebDriver automation.

1) My first script was: 
-  to check the time using the Google search: GooglePage-SearchTest
- to navigate my website: MusicSchop - SearchTest
-  I use also MyUtils Class to navigate WebDriver 
- I use @Before and @After 

2) A bigger challenge for me was preparing a script using the Gherkin and Cucumber methodology:
- the script logs in to the website and completes the address data from the table
  (MyStoreOperate.feature - MyStepsMyStore)

3) The next challenge was to write a script in the Page Object Pattern convention, the script:
- logs in as user - MyStoreLogin,
- enters the product name in the search engine and clicks ENTER - MyStoreSchopping,
- selects the size and enter the desired number; I use Ctr + a - MyStoreSizeAndNumber
- summarizes the purchases and proceeds to select data and payment method and makes a screenshot of the last shopping page - MyStoreCheckOut
  -Screen from the last page is saved in ScreenShot
